### A Sketchpad App in Python/Tkinter

This is a simple sketchpad application built using Python and Tkinter. It allows users to draw basic shapes and perform simple actions. 

The project serves as a demonstration of **class design** and **UX design principles**.

You can download the executable file for Windows x64 [here](https://github.com/frank-labs/SketchPad/releases). Since I do not have other GUI systems for testing, only the Windows x64 version is packaged.

I have journaled my thoughts about the implementation and state management [here](https://frank-labs.github.io/posts/sketchpad-state-management/).
