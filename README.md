### A Sketchpad App in Python/Tkinter

This is a simple sketchpad application built using Python and Tkinter. It allows users to draw basic shapes and perform simple actions. 

The project serves as a demonstration of **class design** and **UX design principles**.

### How to test

If you have Python 3 installed, you can run the application directly using the following command: 
```bash
python /path/to/SketchPad.py
```
The app does not require any external libraries.

Alternatively, you can download the executable file for Windows x64 [here](https://github.com/frank-labs/SketchPad/releases).

Since I do not have access to other GUI systems for testing, only the Windows x64 version is packaged.


I have also journaled my thoughts about the implementation and state management [here](https://frank-labs.github.io/posts/sketchpad-state-management/).
