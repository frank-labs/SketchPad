### A Sketchpad App in Python/Tkinter

This is a simple sketchpad application built using Python and Tkinter. It allows users to draw basic shapes and perform simple actions. 

The project serves as a demonstration of **class design** and **UX design principles**.

I have journaled my thoughts about the implementation and state management [here](https://frank-labs.github.io/posts/sketchpad-state-management/).
